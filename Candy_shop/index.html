                    The history of candies dates back thousands of years, originating 
                    with ancient civilizations who used honey and fruit to
                    create sweet treats. Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, 
                    and Romans used honey to coat nuts, fruits, and flowers,
                    making some of the earliest forms of candy. 
                    Sugarcane cultivation introduced sugar, and by the 
                    Middle Ages, candy-making evolved with spices and sugar
                    to create medicinal lozenges and sweets for the wealthy.
                    In the 17th century, sugar was refined further, leading
                    to a surge in candy variety. Industrialization in the
                    19th century enabled mass production, making candy more affordable
                    and widely accessible. Today, candies come
                    in an endless array of flavors, shapes, and textures,
                     remaining a beloved treat worldwide
